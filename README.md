# HyperAdaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (HANFIS)

# Introduction
The HyperAdaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (HANFIS) is a pioneering implementation that amalgamates the synergistic paradigms of neural networks and fuzzy logic for the optimization of adaptive control systems. This repository encapsulates a sophisticated model architecture designed to autonomously calibrate fuzzy inference rules through gradient-based learning methodologies.

## Abstract
HANFIS is designed to leverage the hierarchical intricacies of neural network frameworks combined with the linguistic interpretability of fuzzy systems. The model is engineered to facilitate the nonlinear mapping of high-dimensional input spaces into granular output decision spaces, enabling an unparalleled degree of adaptivity and precision. This multifaceted approach employs a metaheuristic optimization schema to iteratively refine the fuzzy rule base, enhancing the system's robustness against stochastic perturbations and dynamic environmental shifts.

## Architectural Overview
The HANFIS architecture is an intricate confluence of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy systems. The system's architecture can be delineated as follows:

Input Layer: This layer performs the preliminary processing of raw input vectors, incorporating normalization and feature scaling techniques to ensure dimensional consistency.

Fuzzification Layer: Inputs are transformed into fuzzy sets using membership functions that are dynamically adjusted based on the input distribution. This layer integrates Gaussian, triangular, and trapezoidal membership functions, parameterized through a gradient descent optimization algorithm.

Rule Base Layer: The core of the fuzzy inference system, this layer embodies the fuzzy rule base. Each rule is encoded as a conjunction of antecedent conditions and corresponding consequent actions, formulated as TSK fuzzy rules. The rule base is subjected to a genetic algorithm to optimize the selection and weighting of rules.

Neuro-Adaptive Layer: This neural network layer adapts the membership functions and rule base through backpropagation. The learning process is enhanced using a combination of momentum and adaptive learning rate strategies to expedite convergence.

Defuzzification Layer: Outputs from the rule base layer are aggregated and defuzzified to yield crisp decisions. The defuzzification process utilizes centroid and bisector methods to ensure accuracy in the final output.

Output Layer: The final output layer delivers the processed result, which can be configured for either classification or regression tasks depending on the application context.

# Installation
To install HANFIS, please ensure that you have the requisite dependencies as specified in the requirements.txt file. The installation process is outlined below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/example/HANFIS.git
cd HANFIS

```

# Usage
The HANFIS model can be instantiated and trained using the following procedure:

```typescript
import { HANFIS } from './hanfis';
import { DataLoader } from './data_loader';

const dataLoader = new DataLoader('path/to/dataset');
const dataset = dataLoader.load();

const hanfis = new HANFIS({
    inputDim: dataset.inputDim,
    outputDim: dataset.outputDim,
    numRules: 10,
    learningRate: 0.01,
    epochs: 1000,
});

hanfis.train(dataset.trainData, dataset.trainLabels);
const predictions = hanfis.predict(dataset.testData);
```
